# ML with Spark

Tutorials and code examples from "Scaling Machine Learning with Spark" by Adi Polak. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various machine learning techniques using PySpark, including image classification, text processing, clustering, and model inference.

The notebooks cover practical implementations of distributed machine learning workflows, data processing pipelines, and integration with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch using Petastorm for efficient data loading.
